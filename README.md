# Using Machine Learning Models and Deep Neural Networks for the classification of different dieases

<br>

This is the repository for the project of the course "Intelligent Systems in Medicine", offered by TUHH.

The aim of the project is to build two kind of classifiers using two different techniques:

Objectives of the classifiers:
<ul>
<li> determine whether the chest X-ray Image has COVID-19 or not. </li>
<li> classify the chest X-ray Image into one of the classes (COVID-19, Normal, Pneumonia, Lung Opacity) </li>
</ul>


The objectives will be achieved using two different techniques:
<ul>
<li> using feature extractors and machine learning models. </li>
<li> using neural networks. </li>
</ul>
